# Course: Python for Everybody (py4e)  
An excellent course taught by Dr. Chuck. Got to learn a lot from it.  
The codes presented here were written during the duration of this course. As one can see, I experimented a lot with code to get a better feel for it. It was worth it.  
I still feel a bit uncomfortable about extracting data from webpages (although I made a project on it). Will return to it in future.
